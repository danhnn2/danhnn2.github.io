    <h1>Welcome to this Narrative</h1>
    <p>The Olympic Games are the leading international sporting events in which thousands of athletes from around the
      world participate in a variety of competitions</p>
    <p>We, as a country, are well represented in the Olympics. The number of Olympics medals that we have accumulated
      over the years is, simply, astonishing.</p>
    <p>However, the popularity the Olympics in the U.S. has steadily decreased over the years. Nowadays, the Olympics
      is, sadly, nothing but evening entertainment for most people.</p>
    <p>This narrative aims to show you, the viewer, that the number of medals is not an effective measurement of
      Olympics popularity in the USA.</p>
